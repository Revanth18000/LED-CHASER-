# LED Chaser Circuit with CD4017BE

This project demonstrates a classic LED chaser circuit using the CD4017BE decade counter IC driven by a 555 timer configured in astable mode. The LEDs light up in sequence, creating a "running light" or "knight rider" effect.

## 🔧 Components Used:
- CD4017BE Decade Counter IC  
- NE555 Timer IC  
- Resistors and Capacitors (for timing configuration)  
- 10 LEDs  
- Breadboard and connecting wires  
- Power supply (5V or 9V)

## ⚙️ How It Works:
The 555 timer generates a continuous clock pulse which is fed into the CD4017BE. With each pulse, the CD4017 advances its output to the next pin (Q0 to Q9), turning the LEDs on one at a time in sequence.

## 🛠️ Applications:
- Basic electronics learning project  
- Decorative lighting  
- Visual indicators/sequencing systems

## 📷 Media:
